AI Product Requirement Document - ProjectWise

1. Product Vision & Strategy

1.1 Product Name: ProjectWise - AI-Powered Project Management Copilot

1.2 Problem Statement/Market Need: 
Project teams struggle with fragmented information, delayed risk identification, and inefficient status reporting. Traditional project management tools lack intelligent insights and require manual effort to extract meaningful patterns from project data. Teams spend 30% of their time on administrative tasks instead of value-creating work. Project leads need real-time visibility into risks and bottlenecks, while team members need quick access to project information without constant meetings or status requests.

1.3 Product Vision: 
Short-term (6-12 months): Establish ProjectWise as the go-to AI-powered project management tool for small to medium teams, providing intelligent task management, automated risk detection, and natural language project querying capabilities.

Long-term (1-3 years): Become the leading AI copilot for project management across enterprise organizations, featuring predictive analytics, advanced workflow automation, and seamless integration with enterprise tools.
